## My process

I first started out by writing the HTML for the project. Being a small project, there wasn't much HTML to write. It was primarily a div with some paragraph elements for the text at the bottom. Then I worked on the CSS in order to change the colors, font sizes, as well as margin and padding of the QR code image and the text.

### What I learned

I learned through trial and error how to mostly recreate a static image from a design file. During the project, I struggled with getting the text at the bottom to be aligned with the image at the top as well as getting the correct width of the both paragraph elements. I also struggled a bit with getting the spacing right between the QR code image and the background.

### Continued development

Going forward, I know I'll have to work on everything I have leanred so far in HTML and CSS. This being a newbie project, I didn't think it would be so bad, but surprisingly, I had some issues. This has simply made it clear to me that I have much more work to in order to improve.

### Useful resources

Two YouTube channels that helped me learn HTML and CSS:
- A six-hour course by SuperSimpleDev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc
- A two hour crash course by DesignCourse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXLjWRteuWI
